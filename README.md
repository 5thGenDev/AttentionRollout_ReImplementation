# AttentionRollout ReImplementation
Adapt original reimplementation of Attention Rollout by https://github.com/jacobgil/vit-explain.

The main motivation is to see how following topics affects the Attention Map:
- [ ] Representation vs Based Learning to pretrain model:
          - [ ] Based Learning:
                    - [ ] ????:
          - [ ] Representation Learning:
                    - [ ] Self-supervised Vision Transformer: https://github.com/Sara-Ahmed/SiT
          - [ ] Different latest optimizers:
                    - [ ] SAM: https://github.com/davda54/sam 

Future work will use those aforementioned pretrained ViT as backbone Video Diffusion using SOTA visualizer than Attention Rollout
